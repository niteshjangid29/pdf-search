# ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS / Cloud Services for Deployment
For deploying this PDF search backend, a robust and scalable set of AWS services would be ideal:

- **Backend API:**
  - **AWS EC2 Machine:** For hosting the backend API.

- **Database (Postgres):**
  - **AWS RDS (Relational Database Service):** Managed PostgreSQL database.

- **Search (Elasticsearch):**
  - **AWS OpenSearch Service:** Managed OpenSearch (Elasticsearch) service.

- **Asynchronous Processing:**
  - **AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service):** Api will use SQS to queue PDF processing tasks, worker will pick up tasks from the queue.
  - **AWS Lambda:** Serverless functions to process PDFs. This will download the pdf from S3, perform extraction, embedding and indexing in OpenSearch.
  - **AWS S3:** Storage for uploaded PDFs and processed results.


# üöÄ Project Setup and Requirements

### Prerequisites
 - **Docker Desktop:** Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running on your machine.
 - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Clone the Repository
 - Clone the repository using Git
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/niteshjangid29/pdf-search.git
    cd pdf-search
    ```

### RUN ElasticSearch (preferred using docker)
 - Run below command in terminal to start ElasticSearch
    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh
    ```

 - **Note:** You will get credentials in the terminal output, which are required for accessing the Elasticsearch API.
    ```sh
    Elasticsearch UserName, Password and API Key (required for further steps)
    ```

 - Verify that Elasticsearch is running by accessing the following URL in your browser:
   ```sh
   http://localhost:9200
   ```

### RUN Backend API
- Update the environment variables in the `.env` file (Database is Hosted)
    ```sh
    DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_mOL4n7eRUwEz@ep-square-tree-ad3xa2qc-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/pdf-data?sslmode=require"
    JWT_SECRET = "fdsfneahuw324234ggafergvjndsncwei38aqovzje2uf"
    EXPIRY_TIME=60
    ES_HOST = "http://localhost:9200"
    ES_API_KEY = "<your-elasticsearch-api-key>"
    INDEX_NAME = "pdf_documents"
   ```

- Build the Docker image of the project (in root of the project)
    ```sh
    docker build -t pdf-search .
    ```

- Run the Docker container
    ```sh
    docker run -p 8000:8000 pdf-search
    ```

### Lets go!
The project is now set up and running! You can start using the PDF search API at
```sh
http://localhost:8000
```

# ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS / Cloud Services for Deployment
For deploying this PDF search backend, a robust and scalable set of AWS services would be ideal:

- **Backend API:**
  - **AWS EC2 Machine:** For hosting the backend API.

- **Database (Postgres):**
  - **AWS RDS (Relational Database Service):** Managed PostgreSQL database.

- **Search (Elasticsearch):**
  - **AWS OpenSearch Service:** Managed OpenSearch (Elasticsearch) service.

- **Asynchronous Processing:**
  - **AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service):** Api will use SQS to queue PDF processing tasks, worker will pick up tasks from the queue.
  - **AWS Lambda:** Serverless functions to process PDFs. This will download the pdf from S3, perform extraction, embedding and indexing in OpenSearch.
  - **AWS S3:** Storage for uploaded PDFs and processed results.

# üöÄ Workflow: PDF Upload & Search
**1. Get Access üîë:** First, you **register** and **login** to get a secure access token (JWT). You'll need this token for most actions.

**2. Upload PDF ‚¨ÜÔ∏è:** You **upload** a PDF file to the app. The backend then:
 - ***Extracts everything*** from the PDF: text, tables (formatted into searchable strings), and even text from images (using OCR).

 - ***Creates embeddings*** for all this content.

 - ***Stores the content*** in Elasticsearch for fast searching and saves the PDF's details in PostgreSQL.

**3. Search Your PDFs üîç:** You can now search by typing a query. The app uses your query's embeddings to find the most relevant pieces of content across all your uploaded PDFs.

**4. Manage Your Files üìÇ:** You can also easily view a list of all the PDFs you've uploaded.

# üöÄ Technologies Used
- Backend Framework: FastAPI (Python)

- Database: PostgreSQL (with SQLAlchemy ORM)

- Search Engine: Elasticsearch

- Vector Embeddings: sentence-transformers

- PDF Parsing: PyMuPDF

- OCR: PyTesseract (requires Tesseract-OCR engine)

- Containerization: Docker

# üöÄ Project Setup Locally

## 1. Using Docker (Recommended)

- Clone the repository using Git
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/niteshjangid29/pdf-search.git
    cd pdf-search
    ```

- Build the Docker image of the project (in root of the project)
    ```sh
    docker build -t pdf-search .
    ```

- Run the Docker container
    ```sh
    docker run -p 8000:8000 pdf-search
    ```

## 2. Setup without Docker
- Clone the repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/niteshjangid29/pdf-search.git
    cd pdf-search
    ```

- Create the virtual environment
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

- Install Dependencies
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- Run the Application
    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
    ```

**Note:** This may additionally require to install `PyTesseract` for image-ocr

### Lets go!
The project is now set up and running! You can start using the PDF search API at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
```sh
